# Dextor

**Agents find tools via MCP, pay with x402, and get results in one seamless flow — accessible from ChatGPT, Claude, Telegram, or any client.**

---

## ✨ Overview

Dextor is a universal execution layer for autonomous agents.
It standardizes how agents **discover capabilities**, **complete payments**, and **receive outputs** without friction.

By combining **MCP-based discovery** with **x402 payments**, Dextor enables true machine-to-service interaction across platforms.

---

## 🚀 Why Dextor?

Agents today are powerful, but fragmented.

They can reason, but:

* struggle to locate the right tools
* lack native payment rails
* require custom integrations per platform

Dextor removes those barriers.

One protocol. One flow. Everywhere.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Discover** → Agents locate services through MCP.
2. **Authorize & Pay** → x402 handles payment settlement.
3. **Execute** → The tool runs.
4. **Return** → Results flow back to the agent instantly.

## 🌍 Works Anywhere

Dextor is client-agnostic.

Use it from:

* ChatGPT
* Claude
* Telegram
* Custom agent frameworks
* Backend systems

If your agent can call, it can use Dextor.
